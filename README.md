# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# This Project is initated in VITE+REACT for faster build and also worked with proper routing setup and layout models.

# But after the requirement they expected as single page so I left as a complete setup with routings and then used only the landing page as a single page with bootstrap nav css as a scrolling single page application so In future, If any requirement changes as additional pages like blog, teams, expolres etc.. like that please use the routing module and change things as per their requirement.

# The cava design  for the first banner section is done and commented after which is not suited for the theme and requirements If in future they expect any hover animations in canva please replace those things with your own creativity (only the the content/coding for that without adding or working in css part)
